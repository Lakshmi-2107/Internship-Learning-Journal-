## 🚀 Key Learnings So Far
During Week 1, I successfully set up a complete Linux-based development environment on Windows using WSL and Ubuntu. I learned how to work confidently in the terminal, navigate the Linux file system, and manage system packages using apt.

I configured Python projects using pyenv and UV for version and dependency management, and practiced Git and GitHub workflows such as creating repositories, cloning, committing, pushing code, and setting up SSH authentication.

I also explored modern development tools like VS Code and LLM CLI to improve productivity and interact with AI models directly from the command line.

Overall, I am now comfortable using Linux, Git, Python tools, and terminal-based workflows for efficient and professional software development.

During Week 2, I developed a strong understanding of containerization, backend development, automation, and deployment workflows. I learned how to use Podman to run applications inside containers, manage volumes and networks, and isolate environments for consistent development.

I built and tested REST APIs using FastAPI, handled routing, validation, and file uploads, and practiced testing endpoints using curl and automated scripts. I also containerized applications using Docker and understood how to deploy them to cloud platforms.

Additionally, I explored GitHub Actions for workflow automation, implemented CI/CD concepts, hosted static sites using GitHub Pages, and deployed AI applications using modern cloud tools. I gained practical experience managing environment variables securely and debugging real-world deployment issues.

Overall, I am now confident in building, containerizing, automating, and deploying modern backend applications using industry-standard tools and workflows.
