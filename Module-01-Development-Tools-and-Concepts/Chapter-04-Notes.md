# 📘 Chapter 4 – Development Tools & Project Setup
## Week 1 – Session 4
## VS Code, Homebrew, Pyenv, UV, GitHub CLI & LLM Tools

In this session, we set up the complete development environment required for building intelligent applications. We installed essential tools such as VS Code, Homebrew, Python version manager (pyenv), UV package manager, GitHub CLI, and the LLM command-line tool for interacting with AI models.

---

## 🔹 1. Development Environment Setup

- macOS is Unix-based and similar to Linux
- Most Linux commands work directly on macOS
- Windows users should use WSL for Linux compatibility

Goal:
Create a Linux-like development environment.

---

## 🔹 2. Installing VS Code

- Download VS Code
- Move to Applications folder
- Launch and grant permissions
- Connect GitHub account
- Enable GitHub Education Pack
- Activate Copilot for AI assistance

Benefits:
- Code editor + terminal
- Extensions support
- Git integration
- AI coding help

---

## 🔹 3. Homebrew Package Manager

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS.

Similar tools:
- macOS → brew
- Linux → apt
- Windows → winget

Used to install:
- Python
- Git
- CLI tools
- Development software

Steps:
- Install Homebrew
- Add brew to PATH
- Verify installation

Purpose:
Simplifies software installation.

## 🔹 4. Python Version Management using Pyenv

Problem:
Different projects need different Python versions.

Solution:
Use pyenv.

Features:
- Install multiple Python versions
- Switch versions easily
- Prevent dependency conflicts

Commands:
- install Python
- set global version
- set local version

---

## 🔹 5. UV – Python Project Manager

UV is a fast and modern Python package manager.

Advantages over pip:
- Faster
- Lightweight
- Efficient dependency handling
- Automatic virtual environments

Features:
- Initialize project
- Add/remove packages
- Manage dependencies
- Creates .git automatically

Used for:
- Automation
- Intelligent apps
- Clean project structure

---

## 🔹 6. GitHub CLI (gh)

GitHub CLI allows managing GitHub directly from terminal.

Functions:
- create repos
- push code
- manage commits
- authentication

Basic workflow:
- git add
- git commit
- gh repo create
- git push

Benefit:
No need to use browser.

---

## 🔹 7. LLM Command-Line Tool

LLM CLI allows interacting with AI models directly from terminal.

Supports:
- OpenAI
- Gemini

Features:
- Ask questions
- Generate code
- Summarize text
- Transcribe audio
- Automate tasks

Requires:
- API keys

---

## 🔹 8. Gemini Configuration

Steps:
- Install llm tool
- Install gemini plugin
- Set API key
- Run commands using gemini models

Use case:
- Text generation
- Translation
- Audio transcription

---

## 🔹 Objectives of Session

By the end of this session, we should be able to:

- Set up development environment
- Install VS Code
- Use Homebrew
- Manage Python versions
- Create projects with UV
- Use GitHub from terminal
- Run AI models using CLI tools
