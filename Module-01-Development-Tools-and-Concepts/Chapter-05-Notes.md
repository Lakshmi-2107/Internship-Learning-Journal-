# 📘 Chapter 5 – Git & GitHub Workflow
## Week 1 – Session 5
## Git Setup, SSH Keys, Cloning & Repository Management

In this session, we learned how to properly set up Git and GitHub, generate SSH keys, clone repositories, and manage code using version control. We also practiced pushing changes and troubleshooting common Git errors.

---

## 🔹 1. Importance of Git & GitHub

Git is a version control system used to:
- track changes in code
- collaborate with teams
- manage project history
- revert mistakes easily

GitHub is a cloud platform that:
- stores Git repositories
- enables sharing and collaboration
- provides backup

---

## 🔹 2. Installing Git

Git is installed inside WSL (Ubuntu).

Purpose:
- manage repositories locally
- connect with GitHub
- track commits

---

## 🔹 3. Creating a Repository on GitHub

Steps:
- create new repository on GitHub
- choose public or private
- add README (optional)

This becomes the remote repository.

---

## 🔹 4. SSH Key Authentication

Problem:
GitHub blocks password-based login for security.

Solution:
Use SSH keys.

SSH keys allow:
- secure authentication
- password-free login
- trusted connection

Process:
- generate SSH key
- copy public key
- add to GitHub account
- test connection

---

## 🔹 5. Cloning Repository

Cloning means:
Downloading a copy of the remote repo to local machine.

After cloning:
- work locally
- edit files
- commit changes
- push back to GitHub

---

## 🔹 6. Basic Git Workflow

Standard development cycle:

1. Add files
2. Commit changes
3. Push to GitHub

Flow:

git add → git commit → git push

---

## 🔹 7. Troubleshooting Common Errors

Connection errors:
- missing SSH key

Permission errors:
- wrong account
- no repo access

Solution:
- add SSH key
- check permissions

---

## 🔹 8. Why WSL/Linux for Git?

Benefits:
- Linux-native tools
- better compatibility
- easier Docker support
- smoother development workflow

---

## 🔹 9. GitHub Copilot

AI coding assistant that:
- generates code
- suggests functions
- helps documentation

Improves productivity.

---

## 🔹 10. Pull Requests

Used for collaboration.

Flow:
- create branch
- make changes
- open pull request
- review and merge

Used in teams.

---

## 🔹 Objectives of Session

By the end of this session:

- Git installed and configured
- SSH authentication working
- Repository cloned locally
- Files added and committed
- Changes pushed to GitHub
- Understood collaboration workflow
