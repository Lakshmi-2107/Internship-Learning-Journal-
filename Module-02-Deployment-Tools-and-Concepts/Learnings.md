# 📚 Learnings
## Week 2 – Chapter 1 – Session 1
## Containerization with Podman

This session helped me understand the concept of containerization and how applications can be packaged and run in isolated environments using Podman. I gained both theoretical knowledge and practical experience by running real-world tools like Jupyter Lab, Ollama (LLM), and a Flask web application inside containers.

## Concepts Learned

- What containerization is and why it is important
- Difference between images and containers
- How Podman works as a Docker alternative
- How containers isolate dependencies and environments
- Port mapping to access container services
- Volume mounting for persistent storage
- Networking between multiple containers
- Running local LLMs without cloud services
- Building AI-powered web applications using containers

## Technical Knowledge Gained

### Podman
- Pulling images from registries
- Running and stopping containers
- Viewing container logs
- Removing containers and images

### Storage
- Using volumes to save container data
- Preventing data loss after container deletion

### Networking
- Creating custom networks
- Connecting containers using service names
- Enabling inter-container communication

### AI Integration
- Running Ollama locally
- Downloading and testing LLM models
- Sending API requests to LLMs
- Integrating LLM backend with Flask app

## Skills Gained

- Installed and configured Podman in WSL
- Managed containers using terminal commands
- Deployed Jupyter Notebook in a container
- Persisted files using volume mounts
- Hosted local AI models inside containers
- Connected multiple containers using networks
- Built and containerized a Flask application
- Debugged container and networking issues

## Practical Understanding

Now I understand that:

- Containers are lightweight alternatives to virtual machines
- Applications can run consistently across systems
- Services can be separated into multiple containers (frontend, backend, AI)
- Container networking is useful for real-world microservice architecture
- Podman makes deployment easier and more organized

## Outcome

After this session, I am confident in:

- Using Podman commands
- Running applications inside containers
- Managing storage and networking
- Building containerized applications
- Integrating AI models locally
- Creating scalable development setups

This knowledge prepares me for real-world development and deployment workflows used in modern software and AI projects.
