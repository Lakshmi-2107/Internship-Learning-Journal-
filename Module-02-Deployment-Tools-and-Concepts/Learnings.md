## Week 2 – Chapter 3 – Session 3
## GitHub Actions, Workflows & Cloud Development Tools

In this session, I learned how modern software projects automate development tasks using GitHub tools and cloud platforms. Instead of doing everything manually, workflows can automatically test, build, deploy, and update projects. This makes development faster, more reliable, and more professional.

---

##  Concepts I Understood

### Automation
- Repetitive tasks can be handled automatically
- Reduces human errors
- Saves time and effort
- Improves productivity

---

- Used to automate tasks inside a repository
- Runs workflows when events occur
- Can test, deploy, or update code automatically
- Works using YAML configuration files

---

### Workflows
- Stored inside `.github/workflows/`
- Define when and how tasks run
- Include triggers, jobs, and steps
- Can run on push, pull request, or schedule

---

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Runs tests automatically
- Checks code quality
- Detects bugs early
- Keeps project stable

---

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
